# portfolio-project
I'm proud to share my latest portfolio website, built entirely from scratch with hard coding—no templates, no AI, and no drag-and-drop builders. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and optionally any frameworks you used—feel free to add them!) to design and develop every section by hand. This project was a great way for me to sharpen my frontend (and backend, if applicable) skills, practice responsive design, and bring my personal brand to life through code. The portfolio showcases my key projects, technical skills, and the journey I'm on as a developer. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that pushed me to solve real design and development problems the hands-on way. I'd really appreciate it if you checked it out and shared your thoughts!
