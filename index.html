              <h4>HTML</h4>
              <p>I have recently completed a comprehensive course in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which has strengthened my foundational skills in web development. Through this course, I gained in-depth knowledge of creating well-structured, semantic web pages using elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and multimedia integrations. I also learned best practices for writing clean and accessible code, understanding the importance of semantic tags for SEO and screen readers. JavaScript, and modern frameworks. Completing this course marks an important step in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.</p>

              <p>I have successfully completed a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) course, which has equipped me with the skills to design visually appealing and responsive web pages. Throughout the course, I gained a strong understanding of styling techniques including selectors, box model, positioning, flexbox, grid, animations, transitions, and responsive design using media queries. This project not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also improved my attention to detail and design aesthetics, preparing me for more advanced front-end development using frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.</p>

              <p>I have recently started learning JavaScript to strengthen my front-end development skills. As I progress through the course, I am actively applying my knowledge by building small projects such as interactive forms, calculators, and dynamic web elements. These hands-on experiences are helping me understand core JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, events, loops, and DOM manipulation, laying a solid foundation for advanced JavaScript and full-stack development.</p>

              <p>I have begun learning Java to expand my understanding of object-oriented programming and backend development. Through this course, I am gaining knowledge of core Java concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and file I/O. I am also working on small programs and console-based projects to strengthen my problem-solving and coding logic. This foundation is preparing me for more advanced topics like JavaFX, JDBC, and Spring Framework in the future.</p>

              <p>I’m excited to share a new project I’ve been working on—a fully functional To-Do List app built using Replit for development, Vercel for deployment, and Xano as the backend and database solution. This project allowed me to explore the power of no-code/low-code tools while still applying full-stack principles. The app includes features like task creation, updating, deletion, and completion tracking—all connected to a real backend with a live database. Using Xano. This was a great opportunity to learn, experiment, and build something practical from scratch. I’d love for you to check it out and share any feedback!

              <p>I'm proud to share my latest portfolio website, built entirely from scratch with hard coding—no templates, no AI, and no drag-and-drop builders. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and optionally any frameworks you used—feel free to add them!) to design and develop every section by hand. The portfolio showcases my key projects, technical skills, and the journey I'm on as a developer. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that pushed me to solve real design and development problems the hands-on way. I'd really appreciate it if you checked it out and shared your thoughts!
